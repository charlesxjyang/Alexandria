This problem is amenable to the analysis of dream reports as non-semantic directed word graphs, which provide a structural assessment of oral reports, while controlling for individual differences in verbosity. Against this background, the present study had two main aims: Firstly, to investigate differences in graph structure between REM and non-REM dream reports, and secondly, to evaluate how non-semantic directed word graph analysis compares to the widely used measure of report length in dream analysis. To do this, we analyzed a set of 125 dream reports obtained from 19 participants in controlled laboratory awakenings from REM and N2 sleep. We found that: (1) graphs from REM sleep possess a larger connectedness compared to those from N2; (2) measures of graph structure can predict ratings of dream complexity, where increases in connectedness and decreases in randomness are observed in relation to increasing dream report complexity; and (3) measures of the Largest Connected Component of a graph can improve a model containing report length in predicting sleep stage and dream complexity. These results indicate that dream reports sampled after REM awakening have on average a larger connectedness compared to those sampled after N2 (i.e. words recur with a longer range), a difference which appears to be related to underlying differences in dream complexity.

As a model system, larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) hold enormous potential for studying both the development of behaviour and the underlying circuits, but no relevant experience-dependent learning paradigm has yet been characterized. To address this, we have conducted a detailed study of the effects of experience on the ontogeny of hunting behaviour in larval zebrafish. We report that larvae with prior prey experience consume considerably more prey than naive larvae. This is mainly due to increased capture success that is also accompanied by a modest increase in hunt rate. We identified two components of the hunting sequence that are jointly modified by experience. At the onset of the hunting sequence, the orientation strategy of the turn towards prey is modified such that experienced larvae undershoot prey azimuth. Near the end of the hunt sequence, we find that experienced larvae are more likely to employ high-speed capture swims initiated from longer distances to prey. Combined, these modified turn and capture manoeuvrers can be used to predict the probability of capture success and suggest that their development provides advantages specific to larvae feeding on live-prey.

The exposure to predation and environmental perturbations in the canopy space further obstruct the movement process.

In the Australian stick insect Extatosoma tiaratum, the first instar nymphs hatch on the forest floor and disperse toward tree canopies in the daytime. Here, we address the movement ecology of dispersal in the E. tiaratum nymphs under controlled laboratory conditions. We found the newly hatched nymphs ascend with high endurance, accomplishing 100+ m within 60 minutes. Their navigation toward open canopies is generally directed by negative gravitaxis, positive phototaxis and tactic response to vertically oriented contrast patterns. We also found nymphal E. tiaratum use directed jumping to cross air gaps and respond to tactile stimulations and potential threat with self-dropping reflexes, actions which both lead to aerial descent. In sum, the post-hatch dispersal in E. tiaratum consists of various visually mediated movements both on vegetational structures and in air, within which context gliding is an effective mechanism for height recovery after predator- and perturbation-induced descent.

We found that the symmetry of the arena significantly facilitates how crickets learn to find the center of the arena, both in terms of time spent on the cool spot and the latency of locating it.

To test the hypothesis, we conducted behavioral experiments and employed a new Bayesian model-based comparison method to examine whether crabs have individual behavioral types in the cap making behavior. Crabs were given behavioral choices by using artificial sponges of three different sizes. We modeled the choice of sponges, size of the trimmed part of a cap, size of the cavity of a cap, and the latency to produce a cap, as random variables in 26 models, including hierarchical models specifying the behavioral types. In addition, we calculated the marginal-level widely applicable information criterion (mWAIC) values for hierarchical models to evaluate and compared them with the non-hierarchical models from the predictive point of view. As a result, the crabs of less than about 9 cm in size were found to make caps from the sponges. The body size explained the behavioral variables namely, choice, trimmed cap characteristics, and cavity size, but not latency.

Here, we describe an automated system for measuring bower construction in Lake Malawi cichlid fishes, whereby males construct sand structures to attract mates through the accumulated actions of thousands of individual sand manipulation decisions over the course of many days. The system integrates two orthogonal methods, depth sensing and action recognition, to simultaneously measure the developing bower structure and classify the sand manipulation decisions through which it is constructed. We show that action recognition accurately (>85%) classifies ten sand manipulation behaviors across three different species and distinguishes between scooping and spitting events that occur during bower construction versus feeding. Registration of depth and video data streams enables topographical mapping of these behaviors onto a dynamic 3D sand surface. The hardware required for this setup is inexpensive (<$250 per setup), allowing for the simultaneous recording from many independent aquariums. We further show that bower construction behaviors are non-uniform in time, non-uniform in space, and spatially repeatable across trials.

However, conspecific individuals across species do not temporally coordinate with each other during vocal interactions, maintaining independent and highly stereotyped individual rhythms together with different peak frequencies. Frequency differences between individuals may facilitate sound stream segregation when calls overlap in time.

Previous studies on the dance behaviour in diverse honey bee species demonstrated distinct differences in the combination of visual, auditory, olfactory, and tactile signals produced by the dancer. We now studied the behaviour of the receivers of the dance signals, the dance followers, to explore the significance of the different signals in the communication process. In particular, we ask whether there are differences in the behaviour of dance followers between the 3 major Asian honey bee species, A. florea, A. dorsata and A. cerana, and whether these might correlate with the differences in the signals produced by the dancing foragers. Our comparison demonstrates that the behaviour of the dance followers is highly conserved across all 3 species despite the differences in the dance signals. The highest number of followers was present lateral to the dancer throughout the waggle run, and the mean body orientation of the dance followers with respect to the waggle dancer was close to 90\u00b0 throughout the run for all 3 species. These findings suggest that dance communication might be more conserved than implied by the differences in the signals produced by the dancer.

We characterized female aggression in the weakly electric fish Gymnotus omarorum and carried out acute treatments 1 h prior to agonistic encounters with either an aromatase inhibitor or an antagonist of androgen receptors. Aromatase inhibition caused a strong distortion of aggressive behavior whereas anti-androgen treatment had no effect on behavior.

Only recently have there been attempts to model the cognitive processes whereby people learn \u2013 and track \u2013 non-stationary probabilities, reviving the old debate on whether learning occurs trial-by-trial or by occasional shifts between discrete hypotheses. Trial-by-trial updating models \u2013 such as the delta-rule model \u2013 have been popular in describing human learning in various contexts, but it has been argued that they are inadequate for explaining how humans update beliefs about non-stationary probabilities. Specifically, it has been claimed that these models cannot account for the discrete, stepwise updating that characterises response patterns in experiments where participants tracked a non-stationary probability based on observed outcomes. Here, we demonstrate that the rejection of trial-by-trial models was premature for two reasons. First, our experimental data suggest that the stepwise behaviour depends on details of the experimental paradigm. Hence, discreteness in response data does not necessarily imply discreteness in internal belief updating. Second, previous studies have dismissed trial-by-trial models mainly based on qualitative arguments rather than quantitative model comparison. To evaluate the models more rigorously, we performed a likelihood-based model comparison between stepwise and trial-by-trial updating models. Across eight datasets collected in three different labs, human behaviour is consistently best described by trial-by-trial updating models.

While social behaviors are critical for survival and under stringent selection, surprisingly little is understood about how environmental pressures shape differences in collective behavior. The Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, is a model for studying the evolution of social behaviors. These fish exist as multiple blind cave populations in the Sierra de El Abra and extant ancestral surface fish populations that inhabit rivers and lakes throughout Mexico. Cavefish populations have converged upon many different morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits including reduced social behavior. Dynamically, groups of surface fish maintain close proximity, persistently shoaling or schooling, while their dark-cave-evolved counterparts swim in-dependently, surveying walls and floors for food. To more carefully study evolved changes in individual and social behavior, we track free-swimming individuals in a large circular tank, varying group size and fish type. We find that group size and isolation impact swimming dynamics of cave and surface fish very differently, underscoring the mechanics of their distinct social dynamics. Highly-social surface fish respond to isolation by becoming more inactive while cavefish swimming becomes less persistent in the presence of others. In stark contrast, we find that cavefish actively evade each other upon encounter and respond to increased social density by slowing down. For abstract consideration of evasive interactions, we consider emergent effects of local evasive interactions by constructing and simulating a minimal active matter model and show how this behavior can generate group dynamics that may uniquely benefit exploration of confined environments in the absence of long-range sensory cues provided by vision.

Here, we describe female song in barn swallows for the first time, report rates of female song production, and couple song data with plumage data to explore the relative degree to which dimorphism in signaling traits is consistent with contemporary selection on males versus females. During previous intensive study of male song over two years, we recorded songs for 15 females, with matched phenotypic and fitness data. We randomly selected 15 samples from our larger male dataset to test whether sexual dimorphism in song and plumage is more strongly associated with fledgling success for females or genetic paternity for males. Analyses included 35 potential sexual signals including 22 song parameters and 13 plumage traits. Outcomes indicate that: female songs are used in multiple contexts, restricted primarily to the beginning of the breeding season; song traits were more dimorphic than visual plumage traits; and trait correlations with reproductive success in females, rather than males, predicted sex-based differences in song and plumage. These results are consistent with phylogenetic studies showing that sex-based phenotypic differences are driven by changes in females, highlighting the potential role of  female trait evolution in explaining patterns of sexual dimorphism.

We studied the influence of these two factors separately in mate search tactics and association preferences among zebrafish males. Male zebrafish were presented with a choice of two patches, consisting of different number of females, of which one patch was also associated with a predatory threat.

However, the mechanisms of these neuroprotective effects and the effects of neuroimmunomodulation on cognition are not fully elucidated. This study investigated the effects of GA in preventing age-related immune involution and cognitive disorders as well as the relationship between immune involution and cognition and the underlying molecular mechanisms. Twelve-month-old female C57BL/6 mice were injected with GA (5mg/kg i.v. once every other day) for 6 weeks.

This effect was accompanied by improved cerebral blood flow. Transcriptome analysis of C57BL/6 mice blood by RNA-sequencing and KEGG pathway analysis showed that GA could significantly influence hematopoietic cell lineage. The differential genes in the pathway were clustered using heat mapping, and RNA-seq results showed that GA altered gene expression.

To further investigate the relationship between neuroprotective effects of GA and effects on T and B cells, we tested behaviors after immunological reconstitution and GA treatment using a novel object recognition task in B-NDG mice.

Pregnancy rate of 2982 heifers and primiparous cows was studied as a function of animal category, average daily gain during the breeding season, stocking rate, pasture type and body weight at the beginning of the breeding season. Data were obtained from 43 experiments conducted in commercial ranches and research stations in the Pampas region between 1976 and 2015.

Pregnancy rate was modeled with an apriori set of explanatory variables where proximate variables (breed, body weight at start of breeding, weight gain during breeding and category) were included first and subsequently modeled as functions of other variables (pasture type, supplementation and stocking rate). This modeling approach allowed detection of direct and indirect effects (through nutrition and body weight) of factors that affect pregnancy rate. Taurine (Bos taurus breeds, N = 1058) had higher pregnancy rate than B. Taurus x B. indicus crossbreed (N = 1924) females.

Recent experiments have revealed a \u201cpositive evidence bias\u201d (PEB) in the computations underlying confidence reports. A PEB occurs when confidence, unlike objective choice, over-weights the evidence for the chosen option, relative to evidence against the chosen option. Accordingly, in a perceptual task, appropriate stimulus conditions can be arranged that produce selective changes in confidence reports but no changes in accuracy. Although the PEB is generally assumed to reflect the observer\u2019s perceptual and/or decision processes, post-decisional accounts have not been ruled out. We therefore asked whether the PEB persisted under novel conditions that eliminated two possible post-decisional accounts: 1) post-decision evidence accumulation that contributes to a confidence report solicited after the perceptual choice, and 2) a memory bias that emerges in the delay between the stimulus offset and the confidence report. We found that even when the stimulus remained on the screen until observers responded, and when observers reported their choice and confidence simultaneously, the PEB still emerged. Signal detection-based modeling also showed that the PEB was not associated with changes to metacognitive efficiency, but rather to confidence criteria.

The main thrust was to stick to empirical observations, rather than using black-box models that could possibly perform very well while providing little insight from an ecological perspective. We used a simple model, based on a two-dimensional biased and correlated random walk with three forces related to advection, attraction and immobility of the animal. These forces can be directly estimated using individual raw GPS data. The performance of the model is assessed through 5 statistics that describe the spatial features of animal movement. We demonstrate the approach by using GPS data of 5 roe deer with high frequency sampling. We show that combining the three forces significantly improves the model performance. We also found that the model\u2019s parameters are not affected by the sampling rate of the GPS, suggesting that our model could also be used with low frequency sampling GPS devices. Additionally, the practical design of the model was verified for detecting spatial feature abnormalities (such as voids) and for providing estimates of density and abundance of wild animals.

Since all core m6A pathway mutants are viable, we assessed in vivo requirements of the m6A pathway in cognitive processes. Assays of short term memory revealed an age-dependent requirement of m6A writers working via YTHDF, but not YTHDC, comprising the first phenotypes assigned to Drosophila mutants of the cytoplasmic m6A reader. These factors promote memory via neural-autonomous activities, and are required in the mushroom body, the center for associative learning.

Here we combine experimental and theoretical approaches to study the effect of group composition on individual behavior and division of labor (DOL) in a social insect. Experimentally, we use automated behavioral tracking to monitor 120 colonies of the clonal raider ant, Ooceraea biroi, with controlled variation in three key correlates of social insect behavior: genotype, age, and morphology. We find that each of these sources of heterogeneity generates a distinct pattern of behavioral organization, including the amplification or dampening of inherent behavioral differences in colonies with mixed types. Theoretically, we use a well-studied model of DOL to explore potential mechanisms underlying the experimental findings. We find that the simplest implementation of this model, which assumes that heterogeneous individuals differ only in response thresholds, could only partially recapitulate the empirically observed patterns of behavior. However, the full spectrum of observed phenomena was recapitulated by extending the model to incorporate two factors that are biologically meaningful but theoretically rarely considered: variation among workers in task performance efficiency and among larvae in task demand. Our results thus show that different sources of heterogeneity within social groups can generate different, sometimes non-intuitive, behavioral effects, but that relatively simple models can capture these dynamics and thereby begin to elucidate the basic organizational principles of DOL in social insects.", "subject_area": "Animal Behavior and Cognition", "authors": ["Yuko Ulrich", "Mari Kawakatsu", "Christopher K.

Through integrative studies of behavioural tests and chemical analyses, a novel mechanism for dead conspecifics recognition is found in the Asian bee Apis cerana cerana Fabricius. The bees detect quickly the death of conspecifics based on decreased cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) emissions, caused by the cooling of the dead bee. Specifically, with the decline of body temperature in death, the CHC emission was reduced. Undertakers perceived the major CHCs. Addition of synthetic CHCs, followed by heating, inhibited undertaking behaviour.

We focussed on a feral population of guppies (Poecilia reticulata) that is assumed to undergo a yearly (re)colonization process. Guppies are among the most widespread invasive species in the world, but in temperate regions these fish can only survive in thermally altered freshwaters due to their tropical origin. The investigated population has sustained in a thermally-altered stream in Germany for over 50 years, where they find year-round suitable water temperatures around a warm-water influx. However, in warm seasons, peripheral parts of the warm-water flume become thermally accessible and may be colonized. We sampled fish from the source population and from a winter-abandoned downstream site in March, June and August. Fish were tested for boldness, sociability and activity involving open field tests as well as interactions with a biomimetic robot as social partner. Guppies differed consistently among each other in all three traits. Behavioural trait expression in the source population differed across seasons, however, we could not detect differences between source and downstream populations. Instead, all sampled populations showed a remarkably stable behavioural syndrome between boldness and activity despite strong changes in water temperatures across seasons. We conclude that random drift (as opposed to a personality-biased dispersal) is a more likely dispersal mode for guppies, at least in the investigated stream system.

Yet, structured behavioral patterns \u2013 or \u201cstatistical ethograms\u201d \u2013 are not immediately apparent from the full spatiotemporal data that behavioral scientists usually collect. Here, we introduce a framework to characterize quantitatively rodent behavior during spatial (e.g., maze) navigation, in terms of movement building blocks or motor primitives. The hypothesis underlying this approach is that rodent behavior is characterized by a small number of motor primitives, which are combined over time to produce open-ended movements. We introduce a machine learning methodology \u2013 dictionary learning \u2013 which permits extracting motor primitives from rodent position and velocity data collected during spatial navigation and use them to both reconstruct past trajectories and predict novel ones. Three main results validate our approach. First, our method reconstructs rodent behavioral trajectories robustly from incomplete data, outper-forming approaches based on standard dimensionality reduction methods, such as principal component analysis. Second, the motor primitives extracted during one experimental session generalize and afford the accurate reconstruction of rodent behavior across successive experimental sessions in the same or in modified mazes. Third, the number of motor primitives that our method associates to each maze correlates with independent measures of maze complexity, hence showing that the motor primitives formalism is sensitive to essential aspects of task structure. The framework introduced here can be used by behavioral scientists and neuroscientists as an aid for behavioral and neural data analysis. Indeed, the extracted motor primitives enable the quantitative characterization of the complexity and similarity between different mazes and behavioral patterns across multiple trials (i.e., habit formation). We exemplify some uses of the method to control for confounding effects (e.g., of maze complexity on behavior and reward collection), analyze habitual or stereotyped behavior, classify or predict behavioral choices as well as place and grid cell displacement in new mazes.

In males, the early-life associations persisted across both seasons. Association persistence was not mediated by genetic relatedness or familiarity. The high level of aggressiveness of males, but not females, in the breeding season suggests that males may have played a key role in shaping both their own social environment and that of their partners.
