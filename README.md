# Alexandria
Alexandria is an automated metadata-scraper and visualization tool for bibliometric publishing data in academic databases. We scrape the number of articles for a given set of search terms and plot the number of publication dates over time. We also automatically generate a csv file with the underlying data and use email as the delivery vehicle.  We hope Alexandria will become a valuable, open-source, tool for academic researchers to easily visualize trends in their fields via a simple UI interface with clear and presentable graphics. We are currently in the process of developing larger bibliometric datasets and visualization tools.
